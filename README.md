## Quick Start (Customer.io team)

You can run the following command in the terminal and it will walk you through the steps needed to be able to build the app and test in the simulator or on device.

	bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/customerio/RemoteHabits-Android/HEAD/scripts/setup.sh)"
